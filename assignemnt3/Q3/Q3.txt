There are two main ways a client and server can agree on a TLS ciphersuite. One is client
preference: the client has an ordered lists of ciphersuite preferences, and the server picks the
ciphersuite that is most preferred by the client, and that is supported by the server. The other
method is server preference: the server has a list of ciphersuite preferences and the picks the
ciphersuite that is most preferred by the server, and that is supported by the client.
Deliverables. Place a file Q3 in a directory Q3. Thinking about ciphersuite preferences of the
following clients and servers, use SSL Labs Server Test and SSL Labs Client Test to help you
answer the following questions. For each of the following which ciphersuite would be selected
if:
(a) Chrome 57 connected to whisperlab.org and the server picks
	
	TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

(b) Chrome 57 connected to whisperlab.org and the client picks
	
	LS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

(c) Android 7.0 connected to uwo.ca and the client picks

	TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

(d) IE 7 / Vista connected to uwo.ca and the server picks

	TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
