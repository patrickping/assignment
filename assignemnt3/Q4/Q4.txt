As we’ve talked about in class a single TLS connection involves a lot of keys. In this question
you will enumerate all of the keys used in a single TLS connection to google.ca. This includes
all public, private, and secret keys exchanged or generated during a TLS handshake.

Deliverables. Place answers in a directory Q4. First list the ciphersuite your browser connected
under. The file then should have 3 columns: a description of the key (e.g., Google’s
public ECDHE key), the name of the entities who know the key (e.g., everyone), and a sentence
or two describing the purpose of the key (e.g., used for public key agreement).

Answer: 1. Google.ca's public ECDHE key, everyone, sent to clients for public key agreement.
		2. Google.ca's private ECDHE key, google.ca, to generate public key and form shared secret
		3. Client's public ECDHE key, everyone, sent to google.ca for public key agreement.
		4. Client's private ECDHE key, client, to generate public key and form shared secret.
		5. Diffie-Hellman shared secret. Both Client and Google.ca, made by ECDHE key agreement and to make master secret.
		6. Google.ca's signing key, google.ca, to sign Google.ca ECDHE public key
		7. Google.ca's public key, everyone, to verify Google.ca ECDHE public key
		8. Google Internet Authority G2 public key, everyone, to verify the Google.ca's certificate.
		9. Google Internet Authority G2 signing key, Gooele Internet Authority G2, sign the Goole.ca's certificate
		10. Geo Trust Global's public key, everyone, to verify Google Internet Authority G2 certificate.
		11. Geo Trust Global's signing key, Geo Trust Global, to sign Google Internet Authority G2 certificate
		12. Geo Trust Global's CA public key, everyone, to verify Goo Trust Global's certificate
		13. Geo Trust Global's CA signing key, Geo Trust Global's CA, to sign Geo Trust Global's certficate.
